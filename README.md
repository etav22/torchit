# Torchit
The purpose of this package is to add basic helper functionalities to pytorch code. These functionalites are in the form of:
- train/test loops
- data loading
- visualizations

For this first go around at this package, I will only try working with basic neural nets, with an emphasis around classification. As I continue working on this package, I'd like to append functionality for object detection and segmentation.
